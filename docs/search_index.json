Then, \\(F\\) is called a sigma field (or, sigma algebra; written as \\(\\sigma\\)-field or \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra) if and only if it satisfies the following properties: The empty set \\(\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). If \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\), then the complement \\(A^c \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). If \\(A_1, A_2,...\\) is a sof elements of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), then their union \\(\\cup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). A pair (\\(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}\\)) consisting of a set \\(\\Omega\\) and a \\(\\sigma-field\\) of subsets \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is called a measurable space. The elements of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) are called measurable sets or events. Remarks The set \\(\\Omega\\) is called sample space in probability, but in general measure theory it is called the underlying set or underlying space. Since \\(\\emptyset^c=\\Omega\\), it follows (i) and (ii) \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). Given any set \\(\\Omega\\), the trivial \\(\\sigma\\)-field is \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{ \\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\). One can easily verify that this is a \\(\\sigma\\)-field, and is in fact the smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-field on \\(\\Omega\\). Given any set \\(\\Omega\\), the power set: \\[\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)=\\{A: A \\in \\Omega\\}\\] Consisting of all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is also a \\(\\sigma\\)-field on \\(\\Omega\\) "]
