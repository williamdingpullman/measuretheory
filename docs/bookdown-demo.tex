\section{Measure}\label{measure}}

A measure is a function \(\mu\) defined for certain subsets \(A\) of a set \(\Omega\) which assigns a nonnegative number \(\mu(A)\) to each ``measurable'' set \(A\). In probability theory, the probability is a measure, denoted by \(P\) instead of \(\mu\), which satisfies \(P(\Omega)=1\). In the context of probablity theory, the subset \(A\) is called an event, and \(\Omega\) is called the sample space.

\textbf{Example}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  A die with 6 faces. Thus, the sample space \(\Omega\) is the finite set of integers \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) corresponding to the possible outcomes if we roll the die once and count the number of spots on the fact that turns up. We define a probablity measure \(P\) hese events by \(P(A)=Count(A)/6\).
\item
  Let a random number be chosen in the interval \([0,1]\) such that the probability of the number lying in any subinterval \([a,b] (0 \leq a < b \leq 1)\) is the length (i.ee., \(P([a,b])=b-a\)). Thus, here \(\Omega=[0,1]\). Such a random number is said to be uniformly distributed on the interval \([0,1]\). We can extend the probability measure \(P\) from closed intervals to other subsets of \([0,1]\) (e.g., \(P((a,b))=P([a,b))=P((a,b])=P([a,b])=b-a\)). Also, if \([a_1,b_1],[a_2,b_2],...\) is a finite or infinite sequence of disjoint closed intervals (one can also allow open or semi-open intervals), then we can get \(P(\cup_i[a_i,b_i])=\sum_i(b_i-a_i)\).(It turns out for technical reasons that in this case, one cannot define probability measure of all subsets of \([0,1]\).)
\end{enumerate}

The probability measure of this example is related to a (nonprobability) measure: Let \(\mu=m\) be a measure on arbitrary intervals of real numbers which equals the length of the interval, i.e., \(m((a,b))=b-a\) for any open interval \((a,b),a<b\), and similarly for the other varieties of intervals. Here, \(\Omega=\mathbb{R}\), the set of all real numbers, also denoted \((-\infty, \infty)\). This measure \(m\) is called Lebesgue measure.

\hypertarget{sigma-fields}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(\sigma\)-Fields}{\textbackslash{}sigma-Fields}}\label{sigma-fields}}

\textbf{Definition 1}

Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be a collection of subsets of a set \(\Omega\). Then, \(\mathcal{F}\) is called a sigma field (or, sigma algebra; written as \(\sigma\)-field or \(\sigma\)-algebra) if and only if it satisfies the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\item
  The empty set \(\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}\).
\item
  If \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), then the complement \(A^c \in \mathcal{F}\).
\item
  If \(A_1, A_2,...\) is a sof elements of \(\mathcal{F}\), then their union \(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal{F}\).
\end{enumerate}

A pair (\(\Omega, \mathcal{F}\)) consisting of a set \(\Omega\) and a \(\sigma-field\) of subsets \(\mathcal{F}\) is called a measurable space. The elements of \(\mathcal{F}\) are called measurable sets or events.

\textbf{Remarks 1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The set \(\Omega\) is called sample space in probability, but in general measure theory it is called the underlying set or underlying space.
\item
  Since \(\emptyset^c=\Omega\), it follows (i) and (ii) \(\Omega \in \mathcal{F}\).
\item
  Given any set \(\Omega\), the trivial \(\sigma\)-field is \(\mathcal{F}=\{ \emptyset, \Omega\}\). One can easily verify that this is a \(\sigma\)-field, and is in fact the smallest \(\sigma\)-field on \(\Omega\).
\item
  Given any set \(\Omega\), the power set:
\end{enumerate}

\[\mathcal{P}(\Omega)=\{A: A \in \Omega\}\]

Consisting of all subsets of \(\Omega\) is also a \(\sigma\)-field on \(\Omega\), and in fact is the largest \(\sigma\)-field on \(\Omega\) (Note: in some text, people denote \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\) by \(2^\Omega\)).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  It follows from the definition that if \(\mathcal{F}\) is a \(\sigma\)-field and \(A_1, A_1,...\) is a sequence in \(\mathcal{F}\), then the intersection \(\cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal{F}\).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Remarks 2}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  A set \(A\) is called countable it can be listed as a sequence, finite, or infinite:
\end{enumerate}

\[A=\{a_1, a_2,...\}\]

We shall sometimes say that a set is countably infito indicate that it is countable but not finite.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Any set which can be put in one to one correspondence with a subset of the natural numbers or ``counting numbers'' \(\mathcal{N}={1,2,3...}\) is called countable.
\item
  The set of all real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) (including irrational numbers like \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\pi\), \(e\)) can not put into a one to one correspondence with the natural numbers, so it has ``more'' elements, and is said to be uncountably infinite. These issues are pertinent to the technical difficulties wich make it impossible to extend Lebesgue measure to all subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\), and hence require us to consider the notion of a \(\sigma\)-field (rather than just defining a measure on all subsets of the underlying space).
\end{enumerate}

It takes a certain amount of work to obtain \(\sigma\)-field other than the trivial \(\sigma\)-field (i.e., \(\{\emptyset, \Omega\}\)) or the power set (i.e., \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)=\{A: A \in \Omega\}\)). A standard approach is to consider the smallest \(\sigma\)-field containing a given family of sets. We shall illusrtate this concept. Let \(A \in \Omega\) be a nonempty proper subset of \(\Omega\) (i.e., \(\emptyset \neq A \neq \Omega\)), then

\[\sigma(A)=\{\emptyset, A, A^c, \Omega\}\]

is a \(\sigma\)-algebra (or, \(\sigma\)-field).

\textbf{Example}

If \(\emptyset \neq B \neq \Omega\), \(A\cap B \neq \emptyset\), and neither \(A\) or \(B\) is a subset of the other, then one can obtain a \(\sigma\)-fied \(\sigma(\{A, B\})\) consisting of 16 element (i.e., \(2^4=16\)).

\textbf{Definition 2}

If \(\mathcal{C}\) is any collection of subsets of \(\Omega\), then the \(\sigma\)-field generated by \(\mathcal{C}\), denoted \(\sigma(\mathcal{C})\), is the smallest \(\sigma\)-field containing \(\mathcal{C}\). Hence, ``smallest'' means that if \(mathcal{F}\) is any \(\sigma\)-field containing \(\mathcal{C}\), then \(\sigma(\mathcal{C}) \in \mathcal{F}\).

\textbf{Definition 3}

The Borel \(\sigma\)-field \(\mathcal{B}\) on \(\mathbb{R}\) is the \(\sigma\)-field generated by the collection of all finite open intervals. In symbols,

\[\mathcal{B}=\sigma({(a,b): -\infty < a <b< \infty})\]

The elements of \(\mathcal{B}\) are called Borel sets.
